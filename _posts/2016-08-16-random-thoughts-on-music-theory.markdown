Title explains what this is about.

### 16 August 2016

Was checking out [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qIP3_YLKpk) video (Contortionist - Language 1) and learned about standard C# tuning on a 6 string bass guitar today. He's used tuning G# C# F# B E A. Killer bass tone. [This wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D%E2%99%AD_tuning) says something different about C# standard, though.

Trying out some interval training with [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPSRH3tf5B8) today. Supposd to be really good.

So there are two types of intervals: harmonic and melodic. Harmonic is when is two or more notes are played at a time and melodic is when two or more notes are played separately. 

Intervals are described by some properties:
- Quality: Whether it is perfect, major, minor, augmented or diminished. Perfect intervals, if they're raised by half step become augmented, if they are lowered by half step they become diminished. If perfect intervals are inverted, they remain perfect intervals. So a perfect fifth interved becomes a perfect fourth, and vice versa a perfect fourth interved becomes a perfect fifth. Minor or major intervals can become augmented or diminshed but never perfect.
- Number: Unison, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th,6th,7th, 8th, etc. Number of the interval is the number of letter names that the letter name spans. For example, C to G is a fifth because it spans 5 letter names C-D-E-F-G.

A dyad is a two note chord.

Aural characterestics of intervals:
Consonance category: 
Perfect fifth and octaves are open consonances. Major and minor thirds and sixths are called soft consonances. 

Dissonant category:
Minor sevenths (C-Bb) and major seconds (C-D) are called mild dissonances. Minor seconds (like C-Db) and major sevenths (C-B) are called sharp dissonances.

The perfect fourth is characterized as a consonant or distant interval depending on its used in context. If a perfect 4th is part of a second inversion major triad 

The major 6th interval can be remebered with 'My Bonnie Lies...'.

To identify a minor 6th interval, play the first inversion of the triad and then play the 1st and 3rd of the inversion.

To identify a major 6th, play the second inversion of the triad so you get the 1st and 3rd notes at a major 6th interval.
