As a non-Japanese speaking doctoral student in Japan, applying for JSPS DC scholarship
can be a daunting task if you don't speak Japanese very well. While the main application
is accepted in English, most of the information available online is entirely in Japanese.

In this post I will try to distill the procedure and provide some tips so that you can
find your way around the application procedure with slightly more ease.
