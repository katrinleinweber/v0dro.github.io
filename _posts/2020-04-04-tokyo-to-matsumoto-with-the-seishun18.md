# Introduction

We wanted to head to Matsumoto for a short 2-day trip to escape the hustle and bustle of
Tokyo. However taking the direct Limited Express train from Shinjuku to Matsumoto is
prohitively expensive (about 6000 JPY one way) and therefore decided to use the Seishun18
pass from Tokyo which cost us about 2410 JPY one way.

The only downside of using the Seishun18 is that it takes longer and you need three transfers.
This short post is about which trains we took for this particular trip.
