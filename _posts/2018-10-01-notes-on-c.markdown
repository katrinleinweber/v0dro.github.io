Some things that strike me as peculiar when using C++.

## Use of const

The `const` keyword can be used for declaring a variable as immutable when it is being
used/returned from a function or for indicating that a function does not make any
modifications to the values that contained within a class or to the arguments that
are passed to it. The latter behaviour is called const correctness. It can be specified
in a function by making the function declaration like so:
```
int foo(int a) const; // <- notice the const at the end.
```

## Smart pointers

Smart pointers are an interesting way of implementing the "Resource Acquisition is Initilization"
idiom. In practical terms, the main principle of RAII is to give ownership of any heap-allocated 
resource—for example, dynamically-allocated memory or system object handles—to a stack-allocated
object whose destructor contains the code to delete or free the resource and also any associated 
cleanup code.
