Hi!

I'm Sameer. I live in Pune, India and I love programming, travelling and listening/playing music.

On the programming front, I am currently working on making Ruby a more sought after tool for Scientific Computation. I contribute to the [SciRuby](www.sciruby.com) project in that regard.

In my spare time I love reading books, cycling and watching Star Trek.

I hope you find my blog useful. If you have any suggestions/queries, feel free to drop me a mail at sameer.deshmukh93 at icloud dot com.
