<p>Read about infiband today: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/InfiniBand
https://www.hpcwire.com/off-the-wire/infiniband-accelerates-worlds-fastest-supercomputers/</p>

<p>I think Iâ€™ll be coming across this tech a lot more in the next few months!</p>

<p>I also learned a little about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switched_fabric">switched fabric topology</a> a new network topology that yields higher overall throughput than other traditional topologies.</p>

<p>Read this article on quantum computing: http://superposition.com/2017/11/13/quantum-sensei-discussing-quantum-annealing-hidetoshi-nishimori/</p>

<p>Its really cool to know that one of the most significant contributors to the field works in my University!</p>

<p>Read more on gate-model quantum computer.</p>
