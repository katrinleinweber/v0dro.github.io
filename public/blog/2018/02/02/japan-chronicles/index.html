<p>Since the past 4 months I have been very busy with settling down into a new life and doing some 
really challenging work at my University. In this subsection I will document my experiences of 
travelling around the wonderful city of Tokyo. You can of course follow my <a href="">instagram</a> or 
<a href="">twitter</a> for quick updates :)</p>
