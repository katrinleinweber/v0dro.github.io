A page with my daily log. I list interesting stuff that I happened to read or things that I saw over here.

Read about infiband today: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/InfiniBand
https://www.hpcwire.com/off-the-wire/infiniband-accelerates-worlds-fastest-supercomputers/

I think I'll be coming across this tech a lot more in the next few months!

I also learned a little about [switched fabric topology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switched_fabric) a new network topology that yields higher overall throughput than other traditional topologies.

Read this article on quantum computing: http://superposition.com/2017/11/13/quantum-sensei-discussing-quantum-annealing-hidetoshi-nishimori/

Its really cool to know that one of the most significant contributors to the field works in my University!

Read more on gate-model quantum computer.
