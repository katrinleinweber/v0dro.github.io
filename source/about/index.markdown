# Introduction

I'm Sameer. I live in Tokyo, Japan and I love programming, travelling and listening/playing music.

I am currently a Master's degree student at Tokyo Institute of Technology at the Rio Yokota lab, researching on N-body simulations using the Fast Multipole Method. I also work on making Ruby a better language for Scientific Computing and contribute to libraries of the Ruby Science Foundation for this purpose.

In my spare time I love reading books and playing my bass guitar.
