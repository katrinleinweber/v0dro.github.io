# Reflections of life in Tokyo

# Travelling aroung Tokyo

Since the past 4 months I have been very busy with settling down into a new life and doing some really challenging work at my University. In this subsection I will document my experiences of travelling around the wonderful city of Tokyo. You can of course follow my [instagram]() or [twitter]() for quick updates :)
