Hampi
-----

Our Engineering exams were just over, and we decided to get out of the rut by going backpacking. Thus we reached upon a plan to backpack to South India. Since we had only one week to spare due to family commitments, we chose a route that would take us down south and give us a piece of heritage and leisure as well.

We refered to some posts on the internet, and concluded that Hampi would be an ideal starting point to get what we wanted to set out for. The erstwhile capital of the mighty Vijaynagar empire, Hampi saw a period of power and growth under the tutelage of King Krishnadevaraya, who was a fantastic strategist, administrator and a patron of the arts.

Althogh destroyed due to invasions of Muslim rulers from the Deccan plateau, the remains of Hampi still bear testament to the craftsmanship of Indian artists during the middle ages and the foresight and economic might of their patrons.

We took one of the regular buses that ply between Pune and Hospet, and reached Hospet at 8 am, after which a ride in a rickshaw took us to Hampi. The first thing  one notices while riding into Hampi is the massive, ornately decorated [gopuram](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gopuram) of the [Virupaksha Temple](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virupaksha_Temple). This is also one of the few temples in Hampi that is still actively used in worship.

We checked into a hotel
