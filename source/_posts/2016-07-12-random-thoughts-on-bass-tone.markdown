This post is about my learnings about bass tone. I'm currently using the following rig:

* Laney RB2 amplifier
* Tech 21 Sansamp Bass Driver Programmable DI
* Fender Mexican Standard Jazz Bass (4 string)

I will updating this post as and when I learn something new that I'd like to document or share. Suggestions are welcome. You can email me (see the 'about' section) or post a comment below.

As of now I'm tweaking the sansamp and trying to achieve good tone that will compliment the post/prog rock sound of my band [Cat Kamikazee](). I'm also reading up on different terminologies and use cases on the internet. For instance I found [this explanation](http://www.premierguitar.com/articles/solving-the-bass-di-dilemma-1) on DI boxes quite useful. For instance I learned that the 'XLR Out Pad' button on the sansamp actually provides a 20 db cut to the soundboard if your signal is too hot.

I am trying to couple the sansamp with a basic overdrive pedal I picked up from a friend. [This thread on talkbass](https://www.talkbass.com/threads/sansamp-bddi-pedal-placement.843750/) is pretty useful for that. The guy who answered the question states that it's better to place the sansamp last in the chain so that the DI can deliver the output of the sound chain.

So the BLEND knob on the sansamp modulates how much of the dry signal is mixed with the sansamp tube amplifier emulation circutry. Can be useful when chaining effects pedals with the sansamp by reducing the blend and letting more of the dry signal pass through. Btw the _bass_, _treble_ and _level_ controls remain active irrespective of the position of BLEND.

One thing that was a little confusing was the whole thing about 'harmonic partials'. I found a pretty informative thread about the same on [this TalkBass thread](https://www.talkbass.com/threads/what-are-upper-harmonics-or-harmonic-partials.471553/).

[Here's](http://www.studybass.com/gear/bass-effects/bass-compressor-settings/) an interesting piece on compressors.

Some more useful links I came across over the course of the past few days:

Found an interesting and informative piece on bass pedals [here](http://www.premierguitar.com/articles/Bass_Pedals_Basic_to_Playhouse). It's a good walkthrough of different pedal types and their functionality and purpose.

I wanted to check out some overdrive pedals today but was soon sinking in a sea of terminologies. One thing that intrigued me is the difference between an overdrive, distortion and fuzz. I found a [pretty informative article](http://www.gibson.com/News-Lifestyle/Features/en-us/effects-explained-overdrive-di.aspx) on this topic. The author has the following to say about these 3 different but seemingly similar things.

I had a look at the Darkglass b3k and b7k pedals too. They look like promising overdrive pedals. I'll explore the b3k more since the only difference between the 3 and the 7 is that the 7 also functions as a DI box and has an EQ, while the 3 doesn't. I already have a DI with a 2 band EQ in the sansamp.

One thing that I noticed when tweaking my sansamp is the level of 'distortion' in my tone varies a LOT when you change the bass or treble keeping the drive at the same level. Why does this happen?
