Recently, I started development of an emacs language mode called rubex-mode for supporting Rubex syntax highlighting in emacs. This took me to the [ModeTutorial](https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/ModeTutorial) on the emacs wiki, which is a very detailed tutorial for learning how to write new emacs language modes. Before starting the tutorial I had no knowledge of Emacslisp or writing emacs language modes.

In this post I will share some of the important things that I learned about Emacslisp and some things that I think are important about writing language modes for Emacs.
