## Bengaluru - Day 3

Bangalore is the capital city of Karnataka, with a mostly dry climate and lots of gardens. We reached Bengaluru early in the morning and proceeded straight to one of my friends' cousin's place. 

M.G. Road has some pretty good food joints, which are cheap too, so you might start exploring the city from there, which can easily consume the entire day. This is just like any other Indian metro, so if you're looking for backpacking in the south, I'd suggest you avoid Bangalore.

We boarded the bus for Allepy at 8 pm on the same day we arrived there.
