I woke up my travel mates after much haggling at 5 am, trying to get them out of the hotel for what turned out to be the best day of the entire trip. We proceeded towards Matanga Hill at 5.30 am, and reached the foot of the hill after a 15 minute walk. Legend goes that this was the place where Ram killed....<fill that in>.

As we were about to start climbing the hill, a Sadhu waiting at the bottom of the hill asked us to register with the police station before going up the hill. We told the station was closed, so he said its OK and he started  guiding us up the hill. Along the way he told us that he had converted to a Naga Yogi after a stint at a multinational bank and now lived in a cave up the hill (wow), performing his sadhu duties in the temple town. The climb turned out to be pretty trecherous, with steep cliffs and very narrow walk He guided us to the rooftop of the Hanuman Temple present at the top of Matanga Hill, where the sunset can be experienced best, and after inviting us to his cave for tea once we we were done seeing the sunset, set off on his own.
