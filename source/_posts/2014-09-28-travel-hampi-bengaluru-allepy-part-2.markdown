The next day, we woke up at 5 am and proceeded towards Matanga Hill for seeing the sunrise from the top of the hill, and reached the foot of the hill after a 15 minute walk. Matanga Hill has special significance in Hindu mythology, this was the place where [Hanuman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanuman) and [Sugreeva](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sugriva) took shelter after being chased by [Vali](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vali_(Ramayana)), who was ultimately killed by [Rama](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rama).

As we were about to start climbing the hill, a Sadhu waiting at the bottom of the hill asked us to register with the police station before going up the hill. We told him the station was closed, so he said its OK and he started  guiding us up the hill. Along the way he told us that he had converted to a Naga Yogi after a stint at a multinational bank and now lived in a cave up the hill (wow), performing his sadhu duties in the temple town (which blew us away). The climb turned out to be pretty trecherous, with steep cliffs and a very narrow path leading uphill. He guided us to the rooftop of the Veerbhadra Temple present at the top of Matanga Hill, where the sunrise can be experienced best, and set off on his own after inviting us to his cave for tea once we we were done seeing the sunset.

After seeing the sunrise and having some great black tea at the hands of the Naga Yogi, we started our descent, which took around 40 mins, mainly because of the jagged structure of the rocks. A fantastic breakfast of idli and tea awaited us at the bottom at a small cart that sold these. These small carts which exclusively cater a breakfast of idlis and tea are spread accross Hampi, serving cheap and very filling food.

We then proceeded to our cycle tour, which would take us through the outer parts of Hampi; first stopping at the [Kadalekalu Ganesha](http://hampi.in/kadalekalu-ganesha) (Kadalekalu because the statue's belly resembles a Bengal Gram) temple, which houses a massive statue of Ganpati, the Hindu god of wisdom. The statue is now in ruins, after being destroyed by the Deccan Muslim rulers, who thought there was a hidden treasure inside the stomach of the statue, because of its size.

Then we proceeded to the statue of Narsimha and Laxmi. This was a huge monolith of a statue once upon a time, but it was destroyed by the invading army. A lot of it has been restored but it appears nowhere near its former glory. Right next to this is the partially submerged Shivalinga, which happens to be the 2nd largest in the country.
