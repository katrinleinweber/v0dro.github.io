I'm currently searching for master's degree courses in various colleges in Japan and USA. I want to pursue a Computer Science degree specializing in distributed systems. Searching for the right graduate degree courses can get depressing. Here I'm posting various links and leads that I came across through the course of my search.

### 5 August 2016

Searching for options in Japan and started with University of Tokyo. Most of their courses seem to be in Japanese but there are a few in English as well. [This page](http://www.i.u-tokyo.ac.jp/ist_en/en-course/prg.shtml) has some starting info about the English courses. Also found a collection of colleges [here](http://www.mastersportal.eu/study-options/270286872/computer-science-it-japan.html).

So apparently the process for getting into a Japanese college for Master's can take two paths. The first is like so:

1. Talk to a professor and gain a research assistantship with him/her.
2. Give an exam and enroll for a 2 year master's course if you pass that exam.

The second is directly give the exam, but I'm not sure how that can be done since they all appear to be written examinations that are conducted in Japan.

Having a look at the graudate schools of [University of Tokyo](http://www.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/academics/grad_ist.html), [Tokyo Insitute of Technology](http://educ.titech.ac.jp/eng/) and Kyoto University today.

**University of Tokyo**

UoT seems to have some special selection process for international applicants ([link](http://www.i.u-tokyo.ac.jp/ist_en/howto_apply/special.shtml)), though it's not useful for me. There's a decent contact page [here](http://www.i.u-tokyo.ac.jp/edu/entra/index_e.shtml). They've also put up a check list for applications [here](http://www.i.u-tokyo.ac.jp/edu/entra/pdf/check_list_m_e_revised.pdf).


**Tokyo Inst. of Technology**

This also has a good [graduate program](http://www.titech.ac.jp/english/graduate_school/).Tokyo Inst. of Technology has an [international graduate program for overseas applicants](http://www.titech.ac.jp/english/graduate_school/international/international_graduate/). The courses seems to be in English mostly. The school of computer science has also [participated](http://www.titech.ac.jp/english/graduate_school/international/international_graduate/participating.html) in the IGP and accept the IGP(A), IGP(B)3 and IGP(C) types of applicants. I seem to be most qualified for the [IGP(A)](http://www.titech.ac.jp/english/graduate_school/international/graduate_program_a/index.html) and [IGP(C)](http://www.titech.ac.jp/english/graduate_school/international/graduate_program_c/overseas.html) applications. 

The 'Education Program of Advanced Information Technology Leaders' seems to be most relevant to my case. [This](http://www.titech.ac.jp/guide/guide_28/English/index.html) looks like a good PDF to brief about the program.

All the courses require students to arrange for a Tokyo Tech faculty member to serve as their academic supervisor. [This handy web application](http://search.star.titech.ac.jp/titech-ss/lang.act?forward=search.act&lang=en&) allows you to do that. They also have the MEXT scholarship for outstanding students.

**University of Kyoto**

[Page of dept. of information science](http://www.kuis.kyoto-u.ac.jp/kuis/).

### 17 August 2016

Continuing my research on Tokyo Inst. of Technology. The PDF I pointed to yesterday brought out an interesting observation - IGP(A) students and IGP(C) students seem to have different course work.

### 18 August 2016

It seems the IGP C program at Tokyo Tech. is best for me. I will research that further today. Most probably I'll need to do a 6 month research assistantship first. [Here's a list](http://www.cs.titech.ac.jp/labs-e.html) of the research groups of the Computer Sci. deptartment at Tokyo Tech.

### 20 August 2016

**Tokyo Inst. of Technology**

Found a list of faculties under the IGP(C) program [here](http://www.titech.ac.jp/english/graduate_school/international/graduate_program_c/pdf/listoffaculties_1609c.pdf).

### 23 August 2016

Had a look at Kyushu Inst. of Technology today. The [program for international students](http://www.kyutech.ac.jp/english/admissions/guidelines/iizuka_master.html) looks good.

Also check out scholarship opportunities at Tokyo Inst. of Technology. Links - [1](http://www.titech.ac.jp/english/graduate_school/international/scholarships/), [2](http://www.titech.ac.jp/english/graduate_school/international/scholarships/before_enrollment.html), [3](http://www.mastersportal.eu/universities/scholarships/13128/tokyo-institute-of-technology.html). There are a bunch of scholarships that can be applied to before you enrol in university. Have a look [here](http://www.titech.ac.jp/english/graduate_school/international/scholarships/before_enrollment.html).

There's also the [MEXT scholarship](http://www.titech.ac.jp/english/graduate_school/international/scholarships/mext_scholarship.html)from the Japanese government.

### 24 August 2016

Found an interesting [FAQ on the UoT website](http://www.ic.u-tokyo.ac.jp/ic/guidance/guide05_e.html).

Also having a look at [JASSO scholarships](http://www.jasso.go.jp/en/study_j/scholarships/brochure.html). Found some great scholarships [here](http://www.jasso.go.jp/en/study_j/scholarships/__icsFiles/afieldfile/2016/03/29/scholarshipse_private.pdf).

### 25 August 2016

Found some scholarships. Also, I can also enrol as a [privately funded research student](http://www.titech.ac.jp/english/graduate_school/international/research_students/privately_funded.html) at Tokyo Tech.

[This](http://www.titech.ac.jp/english/graduate_school/international/research_students/syutugan/data/applicationoutline.pdf) is a PDF that talks about privately funded research students.

Also checking out [Keio University](http://www.global.keio.ac.jp/en/education/admissions/graduate.html) today. They have a program for internation graduate students. Have a look [here](http://www.st.keio.ac.jp/english/admissions/masters_program/index.html).

I also had a look at the [Kyoto University IGP](http://www.kyoto-u.ac.jp/en/education-campus/international/students1). Here's a [listing of Japanese universities](http://www.shanghairanking.com/World-University-Rankings-2014/Japan.html).
