Title explains what this is about.

### 16 August 2016

Was checking out [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qIP3_YLKpk) video (Contortionist - Language 1) and learned about standard C# tuning on a 6 string bass guitar today. He's used tuning G# C# F# B E A. Killer bass tone. [This wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D%E2%99%AD_tuning) says something different about C# standard, though.
