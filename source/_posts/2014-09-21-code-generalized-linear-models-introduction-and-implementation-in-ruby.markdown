Questions to address:
  What is the audience of this article?
    Those who want to learn about the basic theory and implementation(in ruby) of GLM.

    Should have a decent knowledge of algebra.

Article flow:
  Introduction and Overview:
    What does this article talk about?
    This article is about GLM and its implementation in Ruby.
    We will explore the important varities of GLMs - Poisson, Logit, Probit, Normal; the algebraic equations associated with each of them, the meaning of Most Likely Solutions, their exact meanings and the different equations used for estimating the coefficients of the regression equations of each of the GLM methods (Newtown-Raphson and IRLS) and their implementation, including equation computation and class structure in Ruby using statsample-glm. Along the way we will also be looking at the class structure and some key features of the statsample-glm gem.
