Data analysis in ruby has mostly been an obscure topic till now, and daru is here to save the scene!

daru stands for Data Analysis in RUby and it aims to be the de facto library for data analysis and manipulation in ruby. It is compatible with statsample, thus statistical computations can be performed by using statsample's excellent statistics features and using daru for data manipulation/analysis.
