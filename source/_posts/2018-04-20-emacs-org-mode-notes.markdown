Note taking is getting quite tedious these days with just markdown and written notes,
so I started using org-mode, which is supposed to be very good. The results so far have
been fabulous. In this post I will docuement the things that I learned about org-mode
and will update the post as and when I find out new things.

# Expand and collapse headers

Headers are written with `*`. More `*`'s you add more the level of indentation. Going to
a header title and pressing TAB will collapse or expand the contents of the header.
