I"å<p>This year I was the admin for the GSOC projects of the <a href="http://sciruby.com/">SciRuby foundation</a>. Itâ€™s also the first time I mentored a student, having been a student myself last year. Being a mentor is pretty tough task, and for some reason is underestimated by many. I was lucky to have the experience and support of co-admins <a href="https://github.com/mohawkjohn">@mohawkjohn</a> and <a href="https://github.com/pjotrp">@pjotrp</a> throughout the GSOC period.</p>
