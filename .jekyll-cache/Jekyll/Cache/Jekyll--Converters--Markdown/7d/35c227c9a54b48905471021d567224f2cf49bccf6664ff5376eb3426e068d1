I"­<p>Note taking is getting quite tedious these days with just markdown and written notes,
so I started using org-mode, which is supposed to be very good. The results so far have
been fabulous. In this post I will docuement the things that I learned about org-mode
and will update the post as and when I find out new things.</p>

<h1 id="expand-and-collapse-headers">Expand and collapse headers</h1>

<p>Headers are written with <code>*</code>. More <code>*</code>â€™s you add more the level of indentation. Going to
a header title and pressing TAB will collapse or expand the contents of the header.</p>

<h1 id="tagging-and-searching">Tagging and searching</h1>

<p>Link: https://orgmode.org/worg/org-tutorials/advanced-searching.html</p>

<p>Org mode has some powerful search features that allow you to tag certain headers with
certain tags that allow you to search headers by tag. The tag has the syntax <code>:&lt;tag_name&gt;:</code>
after a header. So if you want a header <code>foo</code> as <code>bar</code> you can do:</p>
<pre><code>* foo :bar:
</code></pre>
