I"ð<p>I had just started writing some meaningful code in college and gaining an interest in scientific computation, and really wanted to apply my knowledge somewhere and create a real impact. That is when I read about the ruby <a href="https://github.com/sciruby/nmatrix">NMatrix</a> gem and thought maybe Iâ€™d contribute some code, both for experience in dealing with non-trivial software and the personal satifaction derived from the feeling of my work being used by people around the world.</p>
