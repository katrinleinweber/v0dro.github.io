I"q%<p>I’m currently searching for master’s degree courses in various colleges in Japan and USA. I want to pursue a Computer Science degree specializing in distributed systems. Searching for the right graduate degree courses can get depressing. Here I’m posting various links and leads that I came across through the course of my search.</p>

<h3 id="5-august-2016">5 August 2016</h3>

<p>Searching for options in Japan and started with University of Tokyo. Most of their courses seem to be in Japanese but there are a few in English as well. <a href="http://www.i.u-tokyo.ac.jp/ist_en/en-course/prg.shtml">This page</a> has some starting info about the English courses. Also found a collection of colleges <a href="http://www.mastersportal.eu/study-options/270286872/computer-science-it-japan.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>So apparently the process for getting into a Japanese college for Master’s can take two paths. The first is like so:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Talk to a professor and gain a research assistantship with him/her.</li>
  <li>Give an exam and enroll for a 2 year master’s course if you pass that exam.</li>
</ol>

<p>The second is directly give the exam, but I’m not sure how that can be done since they all appear to be written examinations that are conducted in Japan.</p>

<p>Having a look at the graudate schools of <a href="http://www.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/academics/grad_ist.html">University of Tokyo</a>, <a href="http://educ.titech.ac.jp/eng/">Tokyo Insitute of Technology</a> and Kyoto University today.</p>

<p><strong>University of Tokyo</strong></p>

<p>UoT seems to have some special selection process for international applicants (<a href="http://www.i.u-tokyo.ac.jp/ist_en/howto_apply/special.shtml">link</a>), though it’s not useful for me. There’s a decent contact page <a href="http://www.i.u-tokyo.ac.jp/edu/entra/index_e.shtml">here</a>. They’ve also put up a check list for applications <a href="http://www.i.u-tokyo.ac.jp/edu/entra/pdf/check_list_m_e_revised.pdf">here</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Tokyo Inst. of Technology</strong></p>

<p>This also has a good <a href="http://www.titech.ac.jp/english/graduate_school/">graduate program</a>.Tokyo Inst. of Technology has an <a href="http://www.titech.ac.jp/english/graduate_school/international/international_graduate/">international graduate program for overseas applicants</a>. The courses seems to be in English mostly. The school of computer science has also <a href="http://www.titech.ac.jp/english/graduate_school/international/international_graduate/participating.html">participated</a> in the IGP and accept the IGP(A), IGP(B)3 and IGP(C) types of applicants. I seem to be most qualified for the <a href="http://www.titech.ac.jp/english/graduate_school/international/graduate_program_a/index.html">IGP(A)</a> and <a href="http://www.titech.ac.jp/english/graduate_school/international/graduate_program_c/overseas.html">IGP(C)</a> applications.</p>

<p>The ‘Education Program of Advanced Information Technology Leaders’ seems to be most relevant to my case. <a href="http://www.titech.ac.jp/guide/guide_28/English/index.html">This</a> looks like a good PDF to brief about the program.</p>

<p>All the courses require students to arrange for a Tokyo Tech faculty member to serve as their academic supervisor. <a href="http://search.star.titech.ac.jp/titech-ss/lang.act?forward=search.act&amp;lang=en&amp;">This handy web application</a> allows you to do that. They also have the MEXT scholarship for outstanding students.</p>

<p><strong>University of Kyoto</strong></p>

<h3 id="17-august-2016">17 August 2016</h3>

<p>Continuing my research on Tokyo Inst. of Technology. The PDF I pointed to yesterday brought out an interesting observation - IGP(A) students and IGP(C) students seem to have different course work.</p>

<h3 id="18-august-2016">18 August 2016</h3>

<p>It seems the IGP C program at Tokyo Tech. is best for me. I will research that further today. Most probably I’ll need to do a 6 month research assistantship first. <a href="http://www.cs.titech.ac.jp/labs-e.html">Here’s a list</a> of the research groups of the Computer Sci. deptartment at Tokyo Tech.</p>

<p>Found a list of faculties under the IGP(C) program <a href="http://www.titech.ac.jp/english/graduate_school/international/graduate_program_c/pdf/listoffaculties_1609c.pdf">here</a>.</p>

<h3 id="23-august-2016">23 August 2016</h3>

<p>Had a look at Kyushu Inst. of Technology today. The <a href="http://www.kyutech.ac.jp/english/admissions/guidelines/iizuka_master.html">program for international students</a> looks good.</p>

<p>Also check out scholarship opportunities at Tokyo Inst. of Technology.
