I"å<p>Some things that strike me as peculiar when using C++.</p>

<h2 id="use-of-const">Use of const</h2>

<p>The <code>const</code> keyword can be used for declaring a variable as immutable when it is being
used/returned from a function or for indicating that a function does not make any
modifications to the values that contained within a class or to the arguments that
are passed to it. The latter behaviour is called const correctness. It can be specified
in a function by making the function declaration like so:</p>
<pre><code>int foo(int a) const; // &lt;- notice the const at the end.
</code></pre>

<h2 id="smart-pointers">Smart pointers</h2>

<p>Smart pointers are an interesting way of implementing the ‚ÄúResource Acquisition is Initilization‚Äù
idiom. In practical terms, the main principle of RAII is to give ownership of any heap-allocated 
resource‚Äîfor example, dynamically-allocated memory or system object handles‚Äîto a stack-allocated
object whose destructor contains the code to delete or free the resource and also any associated 
cleanup code.</p>
