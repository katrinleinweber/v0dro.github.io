I"ô<p>Iâ€™m logging into various computers to harness their superior hardware which my
laptop can never support. In this post Iâ€™m documenting the stuff that should
be done for accessing remote files using emacs via your local machine.</p>

<h1 id="tramp">TRAMP</h1>

<p>TRAMP is an emacs utility that lets you edit remote files just like theyâ€™re local
files. In order to access a remote file, you need to use the following syntax
after doing a <code>C-x C-f</code>:</p>
<pre><code>/method:user@host:/path/to/file. 
</code></pre>
<p>In my case, I have the hosts written down in an ssh config file, so I can access a
file on computer <code>a2</code> in the following manner:</p>
<pre><code>/ssh:a2:/home/sameer/a.cpp
</code></pre>
<p>This is so incredibly intuitive and simple!</p>

<h1 id="note-about-fancy-shells">Note about fancy shells</h1>

<p>If youâ€™re using some kind of fancy shell on your remote machine, it might cause tramp
to hang when accessing the machine via <code>C-x C-f</code>. For example, I was using oh-my-zsh
on a machine and tramp refused to work as a result. It started working fine after
reverting to bash.</p>

<p>Hereâ€™s a <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6954479/emacs-tramp-doesnt-work">resource</a> elaborating on that.</p>
