<p>Was checking out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qIP3_YLKpk">this</a> video (Contortionist - Language 1) and learned about standard C# tuning on a 6 string bass guitar today. Heâ€™s used tuning G# C# F# B E A. Killer bass tone. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D%E2%99%AD_tuning">This wiki</a> says something different about C# standard, though.</p>

<p>Trying out some interval training with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPSRH3tf5B8">this video</a> today. Supposd to be really good.</p>

<p>So there are two types of intervals: harmonic and melodic. Harmonic is when is two or more notes are played at a time and melodic is when two or more notes are played separately.</p>

<p>Intervals are described by some properties:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Quality: Whether it is perfect, major, minor, augmented or diminished. Perfect intervals, if theyâ€™re raised by half step become augmented, if they are lowered by half step they become diminished. If perfect intervals are inverted, they remain perfect intervals. So a perfect fifth interved becomes a perfect fourth, and vice versa a perfect fourth interved becomes a perfect fifth. Minor or major intervals can become augmented or diminshed but never perfect.</li>
  <li>Number: Unison, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th,6th,7th, 8th, etc. Number of the interval is the number of letter names that the letter name spans. For example, C to G is a fifth because it spans 5 letter names C-D-E-F-G.</li>
</ul>

<p>A dyad is a two note chord.</p>

<p>Aural characterestics of intervals:
Consonance category: 
Perfect fifth and octaves are open consonances. Major and minor thirds and sixths are called soft consonances.</p>

<p>Dissonant category:
Minor sevenths (C-Bb) and major seconds (C-D) are called mild dissonances. Minor seconds (like C-Db) and major sevenths (C-B) are called sharp dissonances.</p>

<p>The perfect fourth is characterized as a consonant or distant interval depending on its used in context. If a perfect 4th is part of a second inversion major triad</p>

<p>The major 6th interval can be remebered with â€˜My Bonnie Liesâ€¦â€™.</p>

<p>To identify a minor 6th interval, play the first inversion of the triad and then play the 1st and 3rd of the inversion.</p>

<p>To identify a major 6th, play the second inversion of the triad so you get the 1st and 3rd notes at a major 6th interval.</p>
