I"J<h1 id="overview">Overview</h1>

<p>I thought I’ll try something new by recording screencasts for some of my <a href="https://github.com/v0dro">work on Ruby</a> open source libraries.</p>

<p>This is quite a change for me since I’m primarily focused on the programming and designing side of things. Creating documentation is something I’ve not ventured into a lot except the usual <a href="http://yardoc.org/">YARD markup</a> for Ruby methods and classes.</p>

<p>In this blog post (which I will keep updating as time progresses) I hope to document my efforts in creating screencasts. Mind you this is the first time I’m creating a screencast so if you find any potential improvements in my methods please point them out in the comments.</p>

<h1 id="creating-the-video">Creating the video</h1>

<p>My first ever screencast will be for my <a href="https://github.com/v0dro/benchmark-plot">benchmark-plot</a> gem. For creating the video I’m mainly using two tools - <a href="https://kdenlive.org/">Kdenlive</a> for video editing and <a href="https://launchpad.net/kazam">Kazam</a> for recording screen activity. I initially tried using <a href="http://www.pitivi.org/">Pitivi</a> and <a href="http://www.openshot.org/">OpenShot</a> for video editing, but the former did not seem user friendly and the latter kept crashing on my system. For the desktop recording I first tried using <a href="http://recordmydesktop.sourceforge.net/about.php">RecordMyDesktop</a> but gave up on it since it’s too heavy on resources and recoreded poor quality screencasts with not too many customization options.</p>

<p>For creating informative visuals, I’m using <a href="https://www.libreoffice.org/discover/impress/">LibreOffice Impress</a> so that I can create a slide, take it’s screenshot when in slideshow mode and put in the screencast. However I’ve generally found that using slides does not serve well the content delivery in a screencast and will probably not feature too many slides in future screencasts.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/3">Sublime Text 3</a> is my primary text editor. I use it’s in built code execution functionality (by pressing <code>Ctrl + Shift + B</code>) to execute a code snippet and display the results immediately.</p>

<h1 id="creating-the-audio">Creating the audio</h1>

<p>I am using Audacity for recording sound. Sadly my mic produces a lot of noise, so for removing that noise in Audacity, I use the inbuilt noise reduction tools.</p>

<p>Noise reduction in Audacity can be achieved by first selecting a small part of the sound that does not contain speech, then go to Effects -&gt; Noise Reduction and click on ‘Get Noise Profile’. Then select the whole sound wave with <code>Ctrl + A</code>. Go to Effects -&gt; Noise Reduction again and click ‘OK’. It should considerably reduce static noise from your sound file.</p>

<p>All files are exported to Ogg Vorbis.</p>

<h1 id="putting-it-all-together">Putting it all together</h1>

<p>I did some research on the screencasting process and found <a href="http://devblog.avdi.org/2013/01/21/my-screencasting-process/">this article</a> by Avdi Grimm and <a href="https://build-podcast.com/setup/">this one</a> by Sayanee Basu extremely helpful.</p>

<p>I first started by writing the transcript along with any code samples that I had to show. I made it a point to describe the code being typed/displayed on the screen since it’s generally more useful to have a voice over explaning the code than having to pause the video and go over it yourself.</p>

<p>Then I recorded the voice over just for the part that featured slides. I imported the screenshots of the slides in kdenlive and adjusted them such that they fit the voice over. Recording the code samples was a bit of a challenge. I started typing out the code and talking about it into the mic. This was more difficult than I thought, almost like playing a Guitar and singing at the same time. I ended up recording the screencast in 4 separate takes, with several retakes for each take.</p>

<p>After importing the screencast with voice over into kdenlive and separating the audio and video components, I did some cuts to reduce redundancy or imperfections in my VO. Some of the parts of the video where there was a lot of typing had to be sped up by using kdenlive’s Speed tool.</p>

<p>Once this was upto my satisfaction, I exported it to mp4.</p>

<p>The video of my first screencast is now up on YouTube in the video below. Have a look and leave your feedback in the comments!</p>
