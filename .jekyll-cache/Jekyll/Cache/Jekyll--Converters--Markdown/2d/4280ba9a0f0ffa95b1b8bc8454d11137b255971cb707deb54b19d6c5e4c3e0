I"C<p>Old and stable linear algebra libraries like LAPACK and BLAS are showing their age
with demand for computing solutions to much larger problems that before, and need
of modern, scalable and human-friendly interfaces. As an answer to this need, various
labs around the world have come up with their implementations of these libraries,
with the desire to be become the de facto linear algebra package for replacing LAPACK
and BLAS. Some of these libraries are PLASMA, CHAMELEON, SLATE, ELEMENTAL, etc.
Navigating this complex maze can be tough if youâ€™re just starting out.</p>
