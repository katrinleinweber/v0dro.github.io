Hello! Welcome to my world :)

I am Sameer, 1st year Ph.D. student at [Rio Yokota Lab](https://www.rio.gsic.titech.ac.jp/en/index.html) in 
[Tokyo Insitute of Technology](https://www.titech.ac.jp/english/). My current research interests are High
Performance Computing, Distributed Linear Algebra and Low Rank Approximation. In particular I am interested
in better understanding and analysis of parallel programs of MPI+X programming paradigms and run-time based
execution systems for linear algebra kernels using low rank approximation.

I think this is an important problem to solve since gaining analytical insights into program behaviour of memory-bound
kernels using low rank approximation can allow us to better design future exascale systems and run these
algorithms more efficiently on current systems.

I have been an avid contributor to open source libraries since the past few years. I am currently contributing
to [PyTorch](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/), and in the past have led and maintained several scientific computing libraries
such as [nmatrix](https://github.com/SciRuby/nmatrix), [daru](https://github.com/SciRuby/daru),
[rubex](https://github.com/SciRuby/rubex) and [rubyplot](https://github.com/SciRuby/rubyplot) for the 
[Ruby Programming Language](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) as part of the [Ruby Science Foundation](http://sciruby.com/),
a FOSS organization dedicated to promoting and maintaining scientific computing infrastructure for Ruby. I have
also mentored several students as part of Google Summer of Code and love writing technical blogs like
this one.

In a previous life I also played the bass guitar for [Cat Kamikazee](https://www.instagram.com/catkamikazee/),
and did an India tour and released an EP, which you can hear on [iTunes](), [Spotify]() or [YouTube]().

In my spare time I love to read books, go on hikes, play music or hang out with friends.
