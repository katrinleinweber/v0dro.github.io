Hello! Welcome to my world :)

I am Sameer, 1st year Ph.D. student at [Rio Yokota Lab](https://www.rio.gsic.titech.ac.jp/en/index.html) in 
[Tokyo Insitute of Technology](https://www.titech.ac.jp/english/). My current research interests are High
Performance Computing, Distributed Linear Algebra and Low Rank Approximation.

I have been an avid contributor to open source libraries since the past few years. I am currently contributing
to [PyTorch](), and in the past have led and maintained several scientific computing libraries
for the [Ruby Programming Language]() as part of the [Ruby Science Foundation](), a FOSS organization dedicated
to promoting and maintaining scientific computing infrastructure for Ruby.

In a previous life I also played the bass guitar for [Cat Kamikazee](), and did an India tour and released
an EP, which you can hear on [iTunes](), [Spotify]() or [YouTube]().

In my spare time I love to read books, go on hikes, play music or hang out with friends.

Current development setup:
